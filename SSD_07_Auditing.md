## Chapter Summary

Data management is a continuous process. This section covers methods for ensuring that you (and your collaborators) are staying ahead of evolving expectations and requirements.

|  | Key Points in this chapter |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1\. | To be maximally effective, data management must be implemented during the day-to-day course of a research project. Periodically, it is important to check your work. |
| 2\. | Data auditing involves conducting a comprehensive assessment of all data-related activities to ensure that they are being followed in line with a research group’s standard operating procedures. Auditing can also be used to identify gaps and areas where current SOPs are insufficient or no longer work. |
| 3\. | A data management audit can occur retrospectively or prospectively. A retrospective audit involves starting with the final publication describing a set of research findings and working backwards to see what data, documentation, and other materials remain accessible. A prospective data audit involves checking in on data management practices during the course of a research project. |

## 7.1. Checking Your Work

When it comes to data management, it is important to check your work.

Thus far, this guide has covered some broad topics related to the management of research data and has provided some practical tips for maintaining Good Data Management Practice during the day-to-day work of doing science. Now it is time to take a step back, take a breath, and ensure everything is running as it should. 

The very first chapter introduced the following prompts as a way to start thinking about data management:

1. If another researcher were to ask for a copy of the data related to one of your projects, would you be able to easily find it and send it to them?  
     
2. If another researcher who works in the same field as you were to receive a copy of your data, would they be able to use it without asking you too many questions?  
     
3. Are you confident that you will be able to find and use the data from this project three years from now? How about ten years from now?

Hopefully these prompted some introspection and the intervening chapters have helped refine related practices and strategies. But, crucially, these questions are about outcomes. Like many aspects of data management, the idea is to understand the goal and work backwards to implement the activities needed to get there. What these questions do not touch on, at least directly, is how a research team actually goes about achieving their data management goals.

This chapter differs from the others in both length and structure. Affirmative responses to any or all of the questions posed above means that there is at least a semblance of a system in place for managing scientific data.That system may be a largely informal “way of doing things” or it could be a fully documented and refined set of protocols and standard operating procedures. While the latter is preferable of course, there is no singular system that is optimized or even appropriate for all research teams everywhere. But it is still vital that there is a system and that system is checked regularly. 

**Approach 1: Ensuring data quality**

There are several lenses through which a research team can view the act of checking that their data management system is working as intended. Probably the most immediately relevant is data quality.

Recall that the functional conception of data management introduced way back in the [introduction](https://johnborghi.github.io/Supporting_Scientific_Data/SSD_01_introduction) covers practices and strategies designed to support the usability and quality of research data over time. The preceding chapters have largely focused on the “usability” aspect of data management. This chapter finally loops back to “quality”.

A common refrain in many areas of computing and scientific research is “garbage in, garbage out.[^1]” In research terms, this means If information or data is flawed, biased, or of low quality, then results based on that information or data are going to be flawed, biased, or of low quality. **Data quality** is a broad concept that refers to the degree to which a set of data is fit for its intended purpose. As shown in **Table 7.1**., this simple definition belies the complexity of this concept[^2]. A research team may be most concerned with *accuracy* and perhaps *timeliness*, but all five qualities are necessary for a dataset to be useful in a scientific research setting. 

**Table 7.1. Dimensions of Data Quality**

| Dimension | Definition |
| :---- | :---- |
| Accuracy | The data values are as close as possible to real values. |
| Completeness | All of the required data is present |
| Consistency | All data values are entered, formatted, and stored using a standardized set of rules. |
| Timeliness | The data is up-to-date. |
| Validity | The data is in the expected format, of the expected type, and within the expected range. |

Ensuring data is high quality involves several tightly related processes.

* **Quality control (QC)** refers to proactive efforts taken to ensure data quality.  
* **Quality assurance (QA)** refers to detection of problems that have already occurred.

This distinction is somewhat artificial, but **monitoring** ensures that the data management policies and procedures are in place and are being followed. Monitoring of data management activities should be routine and continuous. In contract, **auditing** is a process through which a team determines whether the monitoring program is operating as it should and that data-related policies are adequate and effective. Auditing often involves an outside party (i.e. individuals not on the research team). Because of the time and effort involved, audits are typically only done periodically.

One of the major complications for monitoring and auditing a team’s data management practices is that different types of data, different types of projects, and different research contexts will be associated with different expectations and requirements. 

More on this in a minute.

**Approach 2: We are all learning**

Though it can involve technical elements and tools, data management is ultimately a human process. A data management system is only as good as the researchers on a team remembering to name files appropriately, backup their data, and record the details of their workflow. 

“Best practices” in data management are also a moving target. Circumstances may change, necessitating a change in strategy. Research teams may turnover, necessitating training. Scientists are human, sometimes they make mistakes and forget things.

Much of this can be dealt with through thorough [planning](https://johnborghi.github.io/Supporting_Scientific_Data/SSD_03_Planning) and even more thorough [documentation.](https://johnborghi.github.io/Supporting_Scientific_Data/SSD_04_documentation) But the work undertaken by most research teams \- especially in an academic research environment \- does not occur in a vacuum. To one degree or another, many members of such a team are learning on the job. It is not just students and other trainees learning how to do the job of scientific research. Everyone involved is constantly learning. This is part of the point.

This is not to say that anyone involved in a research project is exhibiting anything less than their absolute best efforts. But mistakes, if and when they happen, are learning opportunities. Discovering that a specific practice can be refined or needs to be changed is also a learning opportunity.

## 7.2. A Data Management Monitoring Toolkit

There is not much more to say about the need to check in on data management practices. So class ends a little early today…

Just kidding.

Unlike other chapters where they are supplementary, this time around the checklists and worksheets are the main event. The whole point of monitoring and auditing data management practices is the implementation. 

To help research teams get started in checking their work in regards to data management, a suite of new materials are presented in **Table 7.2.**. From a thorough breakdown of the activities within a specific research project to a more general evaluation of a group’s data management practices, these tools cover data management at several different levels. Also included is a roles and responsibilities checklist, which is presented to help explicate who is responsible for a given data management-related activity and how often such activities are verified. All of these materials are intended to apply broadly, across many research areas. But one tool may be more useful to a research team than another. As always, they are intended as a starting point and can be used, adapted, and discarded as necessary.

One final note though: Depending on the circumstances monitoring and auditing data management practices may be a rather sensitive affair. Quality assurance and quality control are, of course, absolutely foundational to the scientific research enterprise. Checking to ensure that a practice is being implemented properly is not a critique of a research team or its members. Along the same lines, determining that a different practice may work better than an existing one is not a critique of the person who set up the data management system in the first place.  Remember, scientists are human, data management is a human process, and everyone is still learning.

**Table 7.2.** A Toolkit for Monitoring and Auditing Data Management

| Tool | Intended User | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Data Monitoring Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RdQhIMpM2nrJV0atubpuW6-O31cqcG0OHP_jQWBE7i8/edit?usp=sharing) | An individual tasked with continuously monitoring that the data management practices within a research project are being implemented properly. | A checklist designed to help facilitate regular monitoring of data management practices within a given research effort. |
| [Prospective data audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cPtDmz50TyIsOA7BqMkMbNh20p1rzNsKFOk-k6biHZg/edit?usp=sharing) (Forward track method) | An individual tasked with ensuring data is properly managed (i.e. a project PI, a lab manager, etc). | This checklist is intended to help a research team that their data management practices are implemented in line with their standard operating procedures. This form can also be used to demonstrate where additional discussion and training may be needed. |
| [Retrospective data audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1os4P77RIWVdQGXPH73pmiDYvvaWR8LZ2vynppjUj3xY/edit?usp=sharing) (Backwards track method) | Authors of a published scientific manuscript that present conclusions supported by research data. | This checklist is intended to help catalyze conversations within research teams about the accessibility of the data underlying their published manuscripts. Because it is designed to examine practices retrospectively, this exercise is not intended to be evaluative. But rather it will hopefully help teams evaluate their practices and advance them as needed or desired. |
| [Data Management Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112T8LLfNzkzZ7Ywtm5KPlevJrX03Gq7gR7ibFvvo6Lw/edit?usp=sharing) | Members of a research team who are interested in understanding how data management practices can be improved. | Data management is not a singular process, but rather an umbrella covering a wide variety of practices and strategies.  This rubric is designed to help teams understand where their practices are now, so they can chart a way towards where they want or need to be. |
| [Roles and Responsibilities Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQQxipEb3ER04-riJ-1eogAjO7neDIIpcMijbhMIOyM/edit?usp=sharing) | Members of a research team who are responsible for some aspect of data management. | This form allows a research team to make explicit the individual or individuals who will be responsible for carrying out different aspects of data management as well as the individual or individuals who will be responsible for verifying that these tasks are completed. This is meant to complement documented standard operating procedures (SOPs). |

Definitions:

**Audit (Data Management)** \- An exercise designed to ensure that data management practices are being implemented properly. Is typically very involved and may not involve members of the research team.

**Data Quality** \- A broad concept that refers to the degree to which a set of data is fit for its intended purpose. Highly related to data management, but also includes issues more related to methodological rigor.

**Monitoring (Data Management)** \- A routine and continuous process designed to check that data management practices are being implemented according to standard operating procedures. Is typically less involved than a full audit and involves members of the research team.

**Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)** \- Retrospective and prospective efforts to assure data quality. The terms are often used interchangeably.





### Data Accessibility Checklist

| First Author: Date of Publication: Publication Title:  DOI:  | Checklist completed by: Date: Authors/team members interviewed: |
| :---- | :---- |

The following questions address the accessibility of research data. This questionnaire starts at the conclusion of a research workflow \- the publication of study results \- and works backwards. When responding, please limit your responses to only the data underlying the paper in question. There will be time later to address broader issues.

These questions are not meant to evaluate the findings themselves and less than optimal responses will not be interpreted, on their own, as being indicative of any kind of scientific misconduct. Rather, this exercise is meant to highlight areas in which the data management practices for a particular group or for a particular project may be improved. 

This questionnaire should be completed collaboratively by a data management expert and an author of the paper. These questions are not intended to be evaluative, but rather to facilitate conversation about data management and sharing-related practices and procedures. As such, it is important that all parties are thoughtful and honest in their responses.

### Part 1: The Data 

The following set of questions address the characteristics of the data underlying the results described in the paper. These characteristics inform best practices for how the data should be preserved and (if appropriate) shared.

**Which of the following describes the data that underlies the results of the paper?**

- [ ] It includes primary data (i.e. data collected by the authors for the purposes of addressing the research questions described in the paper).  
- [ ] It includes secondary data (i.e. data collected for other purposes, but re-used to address the research questions described in the paper).  
- [ ] It includes simulated data (i.e. data created to mimic real world data)  
- [ ] It includes data drawn from the electronic health record.

**Which of the following factors limits the extent to which the data can be preserved and shared.**

- [ ] The data contains personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), or other sensitive information about human research participants that cannot be removed or masked without rendering the data unusable.  
- [ ] The data contains sensitive information not related to human research participants (e.g. locations of archaeologically sensitive areas or endangered species, military or government information) that cannot be removed or masked without rendering the data unusable.  
- [ ] During the informed consent process, participants were told that the use, re-use, and/or dissemination of the data would be restricted.  
- [ ] The use, re-use, and/or dissemination of the data is limited by an agreement of some kind (e.g. a data use agreement).  
- [ ] The data cannot be shared due to practical concerns (e.g. digitization would require substantial resources, related files are too large to share or receive using commonly available means).

### Part 2: The Data Availability Statement

This set of questions pertains to the data availability statement for the paper. Depending on the journal, this statement may have slightly different titles, but generally describes if and how the data underlying the results described in a paper can be accessed. 

Limitations on the degree to which data can be shared \- including an inability to share data at all \- are not indicative of less than optimal data management. There are a myriad of reasons why data cannot be made available. However, because a published paper may be how a potential user will first encounter a set of data, the content of a data availability statement is an important starting point for a broader conversation about data management practices.

**Does the paper have a data availability statement?**

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No

**If not, what is the journal’s policy with regards to sharing the data that underlies research findings (i.e. what is the *de facto* statement on data availability)*?***

- [ ] Authors are required to make data available when possible.  
- [ ] Authors are encouraged to make data available, but not strictly required, when possible.  
- [ ] The journal does not have a policy about making data available.

If there is no data-related statement, proceed to section 4\.

**Does the statement indicate that the data is available?**

- [ ] Yes  
- [ ] No

Roles and Responsibilities

The following table is designed to help research teams explicate the individual or individuals responsible for different aspects of data management. This table can be applied either to a specific research project or to a broader research collaboration.

The data management-related activities listed in the leftmost column are general suggestions, additional or more specific activities can be included as needed. Proceeding from left to right, the other columns can be filled in with the following information:

* **Related Documentation** \- As applicable, this column should include a link to any related standard operating procedures, lab manuals, or other documentation describing how the activity should be conducted.  
* **Responsible for Implementation** \- This column should include the individual or individuals responsible for implementing this activity following the directions in the Related Documentation column. Some activities may have individual names listed (e.g. The lab manager), while other activities may be the responsibility of larger groups (e.g. All team members involved in data collection).  
* **Responsible for Verification** \- This column should include the individual or individuals responsible for verifying that the activity is conducted in accordance with the directions in the Related Documentation column. Typically this will be a single or small number of individuals (e.g. The project lead, the PI, the lab manager).  
* **Frequency of Verification** \- This column provides an estimated candance for how often the activity will be checked to ensure all applicable SOPs and documentation is being followed. Activities should be checked as frequently as needed to ensure that data is not lost and kept in an appropriately secure fashion.

We have included a table where team members can sign off on this table. We recommend that this table be completed as part of a project kick off and then revisited periodically, especially if changes become necessary.

The contents of the leftmost column  in this version of the table are suggestions for different categories of activities that may be included, more specific activities that could be be explicated include but are certainly not limited to:

| Planning | Writing and developing DMSPs, Creating and updating SOPs |
| :---- | :---- |
| Data Security | Examining raw data for PII, Ensuring sensitive data is stored properly |
| Data Organization | File and variable naming, Directory organization |
| Storage and Backups | Verifying file formats, Backing up data, Version control |
| Documentation of Process | Maintaining lab notebooks and/or other contemporaneous notes |
| Software and Code | Identifying software versions, dependencies, etc |
| Description and Metadata | Maintaining data dictionaries, readme files, etc, Implementing/following metadata schemes as appropriate. |
| Long term preservation | Archiving data in its raw, final, or intermediate forms as appropriate, migrating archived data into accessible formats and media. |
| Cataloging and Sharing | Uploading data and necessary materials to appropriate repositories, initiating and acting upon data use agreements.  |
| Onboarding and Offboarding | Educating new team members about the above activities and expectations, ensuring continuity of data-related practices. |

## Data Management Audit: Version 0.1

### How to use this form

This form is designed to help a research team or other data stakeholder audit the data-related practices of a research project. The objective is to ensure that the project’s workflow (i.e. the programmatic steps that lead up to a research result) and the outputs of that workflow (e.g. datasets, code, etc) remain intact.

This form is not intended to be a check on the rigor of a given study. Working back to the original data is a very important method for assessing and verifying research results \- especially when questions arise. But the main intention here is to facilitate efficient, collaborative, and transparent research.

As shown below, this form is divided into several modules to cover different aspects of a research workflow or pipeline.

### ![][image1]

Research data is multitudinous. A single project may involve several types of data acquired in different ways and from different sources. Depending on the data, there may also be a myriad of regulations, policies, and expectations about how it should and should not be managed. For this reason, this form is designed to be both customizable and extensible. Depending on when the audit is being conducted, it may be reasonable to only complete certain modules. Additional prompts may also be added to encompass particular data-related needs and activities.

If you are using this form to audit a project, please use what works for you.

### Who Should Use this Form

It depends on why the audit is being conducted. 

**Regular Auditing** 

This form was primarily developed to help research teams verify that all data-related practices are being implemented properly. In such a circumstance, a member of the team conducting the study may be included on the audit team. This may be beneficial, especially if there are instances where the rest of the audit team cannot answer the questions on their own. If this occurs, this should be noted on the audit sheet. In this circumstance, the bar for successful implementation is: “Are data management practices implemented in line with the expectations of the team involved in the research project?”. 

This type of audit should be conducted periodically to verify that data management practices are implemented properly. It would be ideal, though admittedly time intensive, for a full audit to be conducted before project closeout.

**Conducting a Full Audit**

Different types of data necessitate different practices and different areas have their own standards, norms, and expectations. The individual or individuals conducting the audit should have expertise in both the data and the broader context in which the work is being conducted.

That being said, in circumstances where a stricter audit is desired, members of the research team should not be on the audit team. In such a case, the bar for successful implementation of data management practices is raised to “Can a researcher uninvolved in the project being audited find and make use of the data to trace the research workflow or pipeline?”.

### Standardization of Practice

The standardization implied many of the prompts may refer to widely adopted community-based standards, practices defined by SOPs maintained by the research group, or even practices applied consistently by an individual researcher \- whatever is available and appropriate for the project being audited.

### Support for Research Parameters

This form also contains language describing certain research-related parameters being “well supported”. This should not be interpreted as an assessment of the methods used to collect, process, and analyze data. Such an assessment is beyond the scope of this instrument and is handled by other groups and processes (e.g. the IRB, the peer review process). 

In any research project, certain decisions need to be made. In this form, and in the broader context of data management, “well supported” refers to instances where there decisions are justified and (as appropriate) well documented.
