# Sensitive Data / OUTLINE

|[Last Chapter - Monitoring and Auditing](https://johnborghi.github.io/Supporting_Scientific_Data/SSD_07_Auditing) | [Back to the Table of Contents](https://johnborghi.github.io/Supporting_Scientific_Data/) | Next Chapter - Coming Soon |

## Chapter Summary

Be careful. This section deals with the special considerations that must be taken while working with certain types of data, including data that contains protected health information (PHI) and data that comes with restrictions on how and by whom it can be used.

This chapter is built on the principle that all data must be managed, but not all data necessarily needs to be shared (openly).

## 8.1. Setting the Stage

Examples of Sensitive Sharing

**Example 1**

The year is 1997. In the state of Massachusetts, the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) is responsible for purchasing health insurance for over 130,000 state employees and their families. GIC collects a huge amount of data, including details about hospital visits for each employee. After removing several “explicit identifiers” such as the patients’ names and social security numbers, this individual level data is then given to researchers upon request. Governor Bill Weld assures the public that, through the deletion of these identifiers, patient privacy is maintained. 

Latanya Sweeney, then a computer science PhD student, requests the GIC data and spends a small amount of money to buy the voter rolls of the city of Cambridge. As an experiment, she combines these two “de-identified datasets” and is able to identify Governor Weld in the GIC dataset. She then mails a copy of his health records to his office. Word of this experiment later reaches Washington D.C., where debate is underway about what would come to be known as the “Privacy Rule” of the Health Insurance Privacy Protection Act (HIPAA). 

**Example 2**

The year is 2023, National Transportation Safety Board releases its report on the implosion of Titan submersible. Part of this investigation involved interviewing an outside expert. In the publicly available transcript of this interview, the expert's name is redacted. However, using some very subtle context clues the expert's identity can be uncovered from their very first response.

 > **Question:** So how did you get yourself started into submersible operations?
 > 
 > **Answer:** Well, I'm sure you're familiar with my film _Titanic_.
 > 
 > _At the end of his very lengthy response, the "anonymous" expert also states..._
 > 
 > **Answer:** "I had been an avid diver since I was in my teens and I made a film called _The Abyss_ in 1988 which was released in 1989."
