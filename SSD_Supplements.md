| **[Good Data Management Principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dZeyt_6qnnvjfI9PEIXbhRK1ELhfG1NS9jlAn7mFEF0/edit?usp=sharing)** | This document presents each of the ten principles of Good Data Management Practice along with a brief description of each. |
| **[Good Enough Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RbdOQPJUMUKwMvxIgznEBr7_TT_MCGCCWQajCOdEJJY/edit?usp=sharing)** | Sometimes “Good enough” has to be good enough. This document provides a starting point for implementing data management practices. |
|**[DMSP Rubric](https://zenodo.org/records/7710001)**|A rubric for evaluating the contents of an NIH data management and sharing plan. This rubric is meant for educational purposes only and includes an annotated DMSP template. |
|**[SOP Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATWE-zzJoMjR9dumo_e3fOROabIrvRct/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118445803869398413021&rtpof=true&sd=true)**| A template for writing a Standard Operating Procedure. The example given is a very important activity in the scientific research enterprise, making a decent cup of coffee.
|**[Lab Manual Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kPYt2Jo_eI18PlkoMMqAe0McgZC44cad1ErI8CJbF10/edit?usp=drive_link)**| SOPs are not necessarily standalone documents. This template describes how to develop a lab manual.|
| **[Chocolate chip cookie recipe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGvheTT4Di5d5pjcceO_ukUOWWrn4kpbkpeDLJp7I7U/edit?usp=sharing)** | By far the most tangential supplementary material in this whole guide, this is literally just the author’s recipe for chocolate chip cookies. |
| **[ReadMe Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15lOyAQZIkex0aySqZ4giNlXJ-lcN00-NMWGd1wjX5IE/edit?usp=sharing)** | A template for writing a readme file that describes the contents of a dataset. |
| **[Data Index Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qTkKoNBriP5bqoJWyvZl29xvjue9WJIRgCnW7ZQP3LY/edit?tab=t.0)** | This document provides guidance to research teams who need to keep a record of how and where their research data is saved. |
|**[Fantastic File Names](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sITntof9Xn5N0VpfnRnJT_b24C6CEqPAx-Y23uNdnkA/edit?usp=sharing)**|This exercise guides users through some best practices in naming digital files. Similar principles can also be applied to other names, including the names of variables and column headers.|

## Toolkit for Monitoring and Auditing Data Management Practices

| Tool | Intended User | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [Data Management Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cPtDmz50TyIsOA7BqMkMbNh20p1rzNsKFOk-k6biHZg/edit?usp=sharing) | An individual or research team who are thinking through how to integrate data management into their day-to-day practice. | Intended as the start of a conversation around data management, this checklist covers data management practices at a relatively high level. |
| [Prospective data audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEc6qUiaS8WERjAGjzCtpDfGGWz1ZlenfJPZv_pdvEc/edit?usp=sharing) (Forward track method) | An individual tasked with ensuring data is properly managed (i.e. a project PI, a lab manager, etc). | This checklist is intended to help a research team that their data management practices are implemented in line with their standard operating procedures. This form can also be used to demonstrate where additional discussion and training may be needed. |
| [Retrospective data audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jZMPPYIRxgPD24DC6ON-c4JTImHuGcTZ-1m1VtaHPro/edit?usp=sharing) (Backwards track method) | Authors of a published scientific manuscript that present conclusions supported by research data. | This checklist is intended to help catalyze conversations within research teams about the accessibility of the data underlying their published manuscripts. Because it is designed to examine practices retrospectively, this exercise is not intended to be evaluative. But rather it will hopefully help teams evaluate their practices and advance them as needed or desired. [A short form is also available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1os4P77RIWVdQGXPH73pmiDYvvaWR8LZ2vynppjUj3xY/edit?usp=sharing)|
| [Data Management Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112T8LLfNzkzZ7Ywtm5KPlevJrX03Gq7gR7ibFvvo6Lw/edit?usp=sharing) | Members of a research team who are interested in understanding how data management practices can be improved. | Data management is not a singular process, but rather an umbrella covering a wide variety of practices and strategies.  This rubric is designed to help teams understand where their practices are now, so they can chart a way towards where they want or need to be. |
| [Roles and Responsibilities Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQQxipEb3ER04-riJ-1eogAjO7neDIIpcMijbhMIOyM/edit?usp=sharing) | Members of a research team who are responsible for some aspect of data management. | This form allows a research team to make explicit the individual or individuals who will be responsible for carrying out different aspects of data management as well as the individual or individuals who will be responsible for verifying that these tasks are completed. This is meant to complement documented standard operating procedures (SOPs). |
| [Data Monitoring Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RdQhIMpM2nrJV0atubpuW6-O31cqcG0OHP_jQWBE7i8/edit?usp=sharing) | An individual tasked with continuously monitoring that the data management practices within a research project are being implemented properly. | A checklist designed to help facilitate regular monitoring of data management practices within a given research effort. |
