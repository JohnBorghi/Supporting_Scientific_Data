## Definitions of Key Terms

**Good Data Management Practice \-** A way of thinking about the support of research data in the context of twenty-first century science. Includes ten principles related to how data should be defined and how data management should be incorporated into research processes and workflows.

**Data Management** \- Strategies and practices related to the storage, organization, and description of research data. The focus of data research data management is ensuring accessibility, reliability, and quality. As a shorthand, it can be useful to think about data management as processes related to ensuring that data is usable.

**Data Provenance** (also sometimes referred to as “data lineage”), \- The documented trail that describes the origin of a piece of data, how it has been changed or transformed, where it has been moved to, and where it is presently. 

**Data Quality** \- A broad concept that refers to the degree to which a set of data is fit for its intended purpose. Highly related to data management, but also includes issues more related to methodological rigor.

**Data Sharing** \- The release of data for use by others. This includes forms of sharing that are relatively restricted (who data is shared with, what they users are able to do with shared data, etc) and more open forms of sharing (e.g. sharing of data through a publicly accessible repository. 

**Data Standards** \- Agreed upon ways of organizing, structuring, and/or describing a particular form of research data.

**Open Science** \- An umbrella term for a variety of efforts aimed at making scientific research more transparent and accessible. In this guide, we are mostly focused on activities related to the outputs of the research process (datasets, code, etc), but the term also encompasses efforts to ensure that the scientific enterprise is inclusive and equitable.

**Reproducibility** \- Broadly refers to efforts related to ensuring reliability, validity, and credibility of scientific research. Somewhat ironically, the meaning of key terms and definitions related to “research reproducibility” are not standardized across the scientific research enterprise. Throughout this guide, we generally use the term to refer to **methods reproducibility** (the provision of sufficient detail about study procedures so that they can be \- theoretically or actually \- exactly repeated).

**Usability** \- In the context of data management and sharing, this refers to an ability to open, understand, make use of, and build upon a set of data. In the context of biomedical science, “re-use” encompasses a large number of potential activities, including using a dataset for education and training (of both human researchers and algorithms), testing new hypotheses (which can involve combining multiple extant datasets), and more.
